            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Coming by the land, run alongſt by it, but come not ſo neere it, that you leeſe ſight of the ſpire of the ſteeple of <hi>Margat</hi> behind the land, for then you ſhould come too neere it; but if you keep ſo far from the ſhore, that you can ſee the foreſaid ſteeple above the high land, or keep it even in your ſight, then you cannot take hurt of the ſouth grounds. Coming thwart of <hi>Margat,</hi> then you are paſt the foreſaid ſhowlds or ſouth grounds. Run then boldly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118499:5"/>towards the ſhore, and within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the north grounds, which lye farre to the ſouthwards towards the land. Saile on ſo weſt all along by the ſhore, untill that the Roculvers (which are two ſteeples upon one Church) come one in the other, and then you ſhall run in ſight of the firſt boy upon the Laſts, which by e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

From thence you may with little ſhips, or ſhips of little draught, but not with ſhips of great draught, at high water run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Swallow on weſt-north-weſt toward, Sheppy, for it is there ſhowld water, with ſhips of great draught you muſt run through the Fiſhers deep towards Black tayle. You may alſo run from Margat with ſmall ſhips along by the ſhore upon the lead at high water, even unto Sheppy, but in ſailing along there you muſt caſt your tides well, for the flood falleth very ſtrong into the Swallow, and the ebbe to the contrary very ſtrong out.</p>
               <p>When you come by Sheppy,<note place="margin">Sheppy.</note> run within two cables lengths along by it, for to avoid the taile of the Spaniard, untill that you be paſt Quinsborough,<note place="margin">The Spag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mard.</note> edge then off from the ſouth ſhore for to avoid the Noere, which is a ſand that ſhooteth off from the River a good wayes to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon the outermoſt end whereof ſtandeth alwayes a Beakon whereby you may know it,<note place="margin">The Noete.</note> run along to the northwards of it, leaving on the larboard ſide, and along in the middle of the channell into the ſea-reach for to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the grounds which lye off from the north ſhore, goe in ſo along towards Graveſend.</p>
               <p>To ſail with ſhips of great draughts along by the north For land up into the Thames, you muſt (when you are paſt the buyes upon the Laſts) ſail through the Fiſhers deep toward Blacktaile, which lyeth from the ſecond buye upon the Laſts,<note place="margin">Fiſhers deep.</note> unto the firſt buye in the Fiſhers deep,

               <p>Sailing from the buye upon the Laſts, it is a great way, all ſhowld water, ſo that you muſt run over there with high water, but coming near the buye upon the Spaniard, it is by little and little, deeper water. He that will ſaile o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver here, muſt reckon his tides well, the flood falleth there along towards the ſouthweſt almoſt thwart over the deep, and the ebbe to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The ſecond buye in the Fiſhers Deep you muſt leave on the ſtarboard ſide: being paſt that, you come againſt the Blacktaile, to the ſouthwards of the Shoebeakon into the right deep. The eaſt poynt of Sheppy ſhall then lye about ſouth from you. From the Shoe-beakon the courſe is ſouthweſt to the point of Blacktaile, there runneth off a hook which men might (at unawares) ſail within (co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the northwards) in five or ſix fathom, but if you keep from the ſhore in ſeven fathom, you cannot ſaile within it. From Black-tail to the Beakon upon the Noere, the courſe is weſt-ſouth-weſt, leave it on the larboard ſide, as before is ſaid, and run it along the River, in the middle of the Channel betwixt both lands unto Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</p>

Covehit is a ſharp ſteeple like as alſo Leyſtaffe, but Sowle and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſwyke, Albrough and Orfordnes, are all flat Steeples, Sowle and Dunwich lye both upon the high land, betwixt them both is a valley, therein you may ſee Walderſwike,<note place="margin">Sowle.</note>when you are thwart of it.<note place="margin">Dunwich.</note> Dunwich is the beſt to be known of all theſe foreſaid places: it hath two flat ſteeples, and on both ſides ſome trees.

               <p>Betwixt Albrough and Dunwich, about half wayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, lyeth a wood, which is at both ends high, and in the middeſt low with a ſaddle; this you ſhall common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee firſt when you fall with land thereabouts, and is the beſt to be known for to know the coaſt by; the land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and to the ſouthwards, is very low flat chindely land.<note place="margin">Orfordnes.</note> About two leagues to the ſoutwards of Albrough lyeth Orfordnes, betwixt them both ſtand alſo two woods of trees, which ſhew themſelves a far off like Caſtles or Towers.

               <p>Before Dunwich you may anker, there is good lying in eight or nine fathom ſomwhat ſoft ground. Before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough is the beſt road of all the coaſts thereabouts, in ſix and ſeven fathom.</p>

               <p>Along the inner ſide it is alſo every where ſo ſteep, that you cannot ſound it, but on the outer ſide you may run along by it in five fathom upon the lead, untill you come within the ſands.</p>

               <p>When you come near Balſy, whether you be come in from the northwards, or the ſouthwards of Whiting ſand, you muſt keep ſomewhat off from the ſhore, becauſe of a little riffe, or ſmall tayle, that ſhooteth off from the ſhore, thwart of Balſy-cliffe, which you muſt avoid ſomewhat, with ſhips of great draughts, there remaineth at low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon it no more then two fathome, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly perceive it well by the rippling of the tide.</p>

               <p>On both ſides, as well on the n. ſide, as the ſ. ſide of the Teeſe, ſtand two little white houſes for fire-beakons: If you come from the n. wards, and get ſight of them, then bring firſt the two ſouthermoſt one in the other, which ſhall then ſtand from you ſ. and by e. ſaile right in with them, untill that the other two, which ſtand on the n. ſide of the Teeſe, come alſo one in the other, then leave them on the ſ. ſide, and ſaile in right with them that ſtand on the n. ſide, and ſo you ſhall run in amidſt the channel, there is upon the barre, or ſhowldeſt, at low water, no more then five foot, but it floweth there with a common tide, at leaſt two fathome, up and downe.

               <p>When as that you come ſo farre in paſt the firſt fire-bea-beakon, to wit, that you may ſee Hartlepoole betwixt the two fire-beakons, there you may ankor in three, four, or five fathome, or when Hartlepoole cometh betwixt the foreſaid fire-beakons, then goe ſ. ſ. w. until that you come by the ſ. ſhore, there it is alſo good ankoring. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is Pilots water unto Stockton, for there within, the Deeps doe ſhift oftentimes, and that in ſhort time, three, four, or five times in a ſummer.</p>
               <p>He that will ſaile in there with northerly winds, and a floud, muſt reckon well his tides, for the floud falleth ſtrong to the ſouthwards over the grounds, and ſhould there be lightly carried behind the bank to the ſ. wards of the buy, which lyeth upon the point of the bank.</p>

When that you get againe deeper water, or have the two fire-beakons on the n. ſide one in the other, then goe in towards them, and further, as hath been before ſaid.</p>
               <p>About ſeven leagues to the n. wards of the Teeſe, lyeth the River of Sonderland, a little to the n. wards of the Paps, which are very good marks for to know the land by thereabouts. When the Paps are ſ. ſ. w. from you, and that you are about an Engliſh mile from the land, then you are right before the River of Sonderland, the ground is there about indifferent clean, but ſomewhat ſtony, you

On the n. point ſtandeth a Beakon in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there you muſt run in, within a little ſhips length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by it, being paſt that, you ſhall get deeper water, to wit, a fathom and a halfe, and two fathome at low water, but upon the barre remaineth no more then three foot: with a common ſpring and high water there is about two fathome and a halfe, or a little more.</p>
               <p>After this aforeſaid firſt depth of a fathome and a half,<note place="margin">Sonderland.</note>or two fathom, you ſhall meet again with a ſtony floore, about three ſhips length broad, upon it is at high water about eleven or twelve foot deep, according as the Tides ſhall run, being over it there, it is againe deeper. A little paſt that is a narrow place, where a long ſhip ſhall ſcarce be able to wend within it, it is wide enough, and every where good ground.</p>

From the point of Tinmouth ſhooteth off a ledge of rocks, you muſt ſaile in by it, leaving it on the ſtarboard ſide. The marks for to ſaile into the River, are two fire-towers, or fire-beakons, which ſtand upon the n. ſhore, bring them one in the other, or the innermoſt (that is the higheſt) a little to the n. wards of the outermoſt or loweſt, and ſaile ſo right in along by the aforeſaid ledge of rocks on the n. ſide, and ſo you ſhall have upon the ſhowldeſt two fathome at halfe flood: a ſ. w. Moon maketh there full ſea. The ſ. ſhoare is flat, you may lead it in there with the ſounding pole for ſhips that goe not deep, in ten foot at halfe flood. When you come within, run all along by the n. ſhoare, until paſt the little Town Sheels, edge then over to the other ſhoare, untill you come through the crooked reach, there the river lyeth up againe to the n. wards, and then to the ſ. wards, to Hawke-bil, and about by it to the Towne Newcaſtle.</p>

Upon the ſ. point ſtand two Beakons, if you will ſail in there, bring them one in the other, and ſail right in with them, and then you can take no hurt of the foreſaid ledge or riffe of the n. poynt. When that you come by or thwart of the outermoſt of the two foreſaid Beakons, you ſhall ſee there by it another ſmaller Beakon, that ſtandeth upon a little ledge of rocks, that ſhooteth off from the ſ. point, leave that on the larboard ſide, and run in along cloſe about n. wards of it. The foreſaid ledge of rocks on the n. ſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth at high water (a good wayes from the land, and alſo at a ſpring tide) above water, within it is a bight, there it is good lying for a n. or n. e. wind, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth at low water two fathome depth. In the mouth of the River it is with an ordinary tide, and high-water, about two fathome deep, or ſomewhat more, and it floweth there two fathome up and downe, ſo that at low water it falleth almoſt altogether dry.</p>
               <p>The Cocker Iſland is a very little Iſland,<note place="margin">Cocker Iſland</note> and not high, it lyeth about a halfe league from the land, you may come to an ankor in it for an e. ſ. and ſ. e. wind, but the wind coming to the n. wards of the e. maketh there a bad road, for you muſt lye betwixt the Iſland and the maine land, where you have no ſhelter for a n. wind. On the ſ. ſide of the Iſland the ground is foul, and a little to the ſ. wards of the Iſland runneth off a foul ledge of rocks from the ſhore untill thwart or paſt the Iſland.
